# Doyle Investigators - Vector Embeddings and Adversarial Analysis


## Notes for PM meeting on 10/14/20
* All groups will select 4-5 crime novels (same from Project 1) that contain a total of 300K +- 10% tokens. The 4 Doyle's novels used in Project 1 have a total of ~203K words, so we need to select an additional Sherlock Holmes' "crime" novel.
* We will use 3 data resolutions: 350 words (1/2 page), 1400 words (2 pages), and 3500 words (5 pages).
* Groups will share perturbation ideas. Edmon will decide on a handful to from these to be assigned to groups. The perturbations will vary between groups.
* The goal is to replicate the classification approach presented in assigned paper.
* We will use two embedding sizes for the vector embeddings: 50 and 300.
* All groups will share text data as follows: Extract only the prose from all novels (no headings, no metadata) and merge together into a single file with no formatting changes except removing empty lines.
